	<p class=heading>Midterm Project Report</p>
	<p class=explanation>What is the idea?</p>
	<p class=description>I wanted to create a personal logo animation that I can embed into my website &amp; therefore show my creative coding abilities to future employers.</p>
	<p class=explanation>Who is it for?</p>
	<p class=description>This is mostly for myself to show off another way in which I can use assets I have learned to create something interesting in design and function. I believe it is for potential employers to understand the different skills I possess.</p>
	<p class=explanation>Why does it need to exist?</p>
	<p class=description>I mean in the scheme of the world this doesn't necessarily need to exist but it does need to exist in order to show a more interesting way of presenting a logo design. This could in turn make me stand out in a sea of applicants.</p>
	<p class=explanation>Where would it be displayed?</p>
	<p class=description>This will displayed within my own website, either on the first page that loads or on the about me page.</p>
	<p class=explanation>What does it need to do/have?</p>
	<ul class=description>
		<li>Components need to load in a certain order &amp; layered in the correct way</li>
		<li>Creating a fade in/out effect</li>
		<li>Make it so mouse press interactions only execute after a certain point</li>
		<li>Mouse press cycles through different color combinations of my logo</li>
		<li>Let users restart the animation with a key press</li>
	</ul>
	<p class=explanation>What did I struggle with?</p>
	<p class=description>I had a hard time trying to create the fade in &amp; out effect I wanted on the different wave aspects. I attempted to use the tint property but found that it slowed down the speed of the animation. I had to instead use a series of pngs with increasing or decreasing transparency values &amp; make the program run through those with the help of millis.</p>
