            <p id="description">I'm Madison Richard, an artist since the day I was born. I have always been curious about understanding how people and the world around us are connected. I discovered early on that expression and art are the ways in which people try to understand the unexplainable. Emotions that can't be explained can still be triggered by artwork. Sometimes the greatest things are those that can't be explicitly understood at first. I'm intrigued by the idea of turning my love for art and my desire to understand people into pieces of communication that can impact and move audiences.</p>
