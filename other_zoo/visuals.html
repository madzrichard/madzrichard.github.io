			<h3>Subway Advertisements</h3>
			 <p class="description">These four out-of-home advertisements look to catch peoples attention &amp; and make them think about how women are treated in the environment of public transit. There is a sense of uncomfort and friction within the pictures that is accentuated through the contrasting color and black &amp; white. They are all to be placed in distinct areas in which an individual would hopefully see them one after another as they are using the transit system.</p>

 			<h3>Experiential</h3>
 			<p class="description">The uncaged car is meant to be a safe space, that is monitored and gives women &amp; others a little more ease when stepping on the train. It will follow the out-of-home advertisements and reineforce the idea that women should feel free and secure in their travels. The interior mirrors that of the peaceful nature environment that animals are taken out of to be placed within zoos.</p>
				
			<p>The Zoo Keepers were somewhat based off the old school vigilantes of the NYC subway, The Guardian Angels. The Zoo Keepers are in a sense a show of "force" &amp; comforting in one. They are on trains &amp; in stations so the police don't have to be. They are to make men think twice about exhibiting harassing behaviors &amp; women feel safer &amp; looked out for.Stickers will serve as a reminder and comfort to know that the Zoo Keepers are watching to keep people safe &amp; keep real "animals" from hurting anyone.</p>

 			<h3>Mobile app </h3>
 			<p class="description">This app was designed to help in the reporting of harassment in a anonymous way that is specified to differing subway routes. People are able to choose the line they will be traveling &amp; look for alerts as well as report themselves.There are multiple options in reporting, including taking pictures that are automatically sent to the police as well as calling the police or the Zoo Keepers.</p>

 			<h3>Social Media</h3>
 			<p class="description">The Stand Againist The ZOO Facebook campaign is based on encouraging advocacy. There will be a link in which you can create a profile picture with a filter on it saying, "I stand againist the zoo". This is all about women feeling that men are acknowledging the problem and standing up for women. This isn't about being a viral movement but assuring the women in a man's life that they see there is a problem that women have to deal with.</p>

			<p class="description">The Youtube channel looks to drive interest and sharability of the campaign far beyond just New York. We want to curate videos that hear from both sides regarding this instance of gender inequality. We also are looking to film guerilla pranks that go along with the Zoo idea and release these here.</p>
